## File Naming Convention
- Required filename pattern: `implementation-plan-sprint-XXX-[short-topic].md`
- Example: `implementation-plan-sprint-001-anti-dup-hardening.md`
- `XXX` must be sequential across project history.

## 1. Objective
- [Primary objective]
- [Secondary objective]

## 2. Non-Goals
- [Out of scope item]
- [Out of scope item]

## 3. Current State
- [Relevant baseline behavior]
- [Known risks/constraints]

## 3.1 Discovery Snapshot (Mandatory)
- Business objective (problem value):
  - [ ] [Objective and expected outcome]
- Constraints:
  - [ ] [Technical/business/compliance/time constraints]
- Source of truth:
  - [ ] [Systems/docs/owners considered authoritative]
- Non-goals:
  - [ ] [Explicitly not solving now]

## 3.2 Knowns / Unknowns
- Knowns (validated facts):
  - [ ] [Fact + evidence]
- Unknowns (must clarify):
  - [ ] [Open item + owner]

## 3.3 Assumptions and Validation Plan
- Assumption:
  - [ ] [Assumption]
  - Validation method: [Test/data review/spike/production metric]
  - Validation checkpoint: [Milestone/date]
  - Fallback if invalid: [Plan]

## 5. Public Contract Impact
- Affected public interfaces (API/events/schemas):
  - [List]
- Compatibility strategy:
  - [Preserve | Additive | Versioned break]
- Contract artifacts to update:
  - [OpenAPI/JSON Schema/tests/docs]

## 6. Observability Contract
- Critical paths covered:
  - [List]
- Required fields emitted:
  - [ ] `request_id`
  - [ ] `duration_ms`
  - [ ] structured logs
- Verification approach:
  - [Unit/integration/contract assertions]

## 7. Payload Limits & Validation
- Limits applied (or project equivalents):
  - `IMPORT_MAX_FILE_MB`: [value]
  - `IMPORT_MAX_ITEMS`: [value]
  - `PROMPT_MAX_BYTES`: [value]
- Validation behavior:
  - [Accepted/rejected boundaries + error model]
- Negative tests:
  - [List]

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Measurable criterion]
- [ ] [Measurable criterion]
- [ ] Critical unknowns resolved or explicitly risk-accepted.
- [ ] High-impact assumptions validated or protected by monitoring/fallback.
- [ ] Discovery evidence captured in plan and PR.

## 9. Quality Gates
- [ ] Tests pass (project command and CI lane).
- [ ] No relevant duplication increase (baseline gate).
- [ ] Contract/API behavior preserved or intentionally versioned.
- [ ] Observability contract validated (`request_id`, `duration_ms`, structured logs).
- [ ] Payload limits and validation enforced for changed critical flows.
- [ ] Documentation updated (README and related docs).
- [ ] Discovery Gate passed (critical questions answered; residual risks explicit).
- [ ] Assumption traceability passed (owner + validation + fallback for each critical assumption).

## 10. Milestones and Readiness
- Milestone mapping:
  - M1: [Definition + exit criteria]
  - M2: [Definition + exit criteria]
  - M3: [Definition + exit criteria]
- Promotion rule:
  - [Which gate evidence is required to move milestones]
